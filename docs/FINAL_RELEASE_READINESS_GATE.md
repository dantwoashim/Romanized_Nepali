Blocked:

- native dev build validation for installed keyboard pilot.
- human feedback does not exist yet.
- Traditional physical layout not validated.

## Public Beta Gate

Status: blocked-external.

Required:

- signed Windows build.
- signed/notarized macOS build.
- installer/update/uninstall validation.
- pilot feedback triage.
- privacy review.

## Stable Launch Gate
